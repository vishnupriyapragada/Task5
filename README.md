Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.
Using Python’s Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform data visualization, and statistical analysis.

Steps Performed:

* Data Overview – Checked shape, columns, data types, and missing values.

* Univariate Analysis – Distribution of age, gender, class, and survival rates.

* Bivariate Analysis – Relationships between survival and features like:

* Passenger Class vs Survival

* Gender vs Survival

* Age vs Survival (Boxplot)

* Family Size vs Survival

Insights –

* Gender Impact: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

* Class Privilege: 1st Class passengers were significantly more likely to survive than 2nd and 3rd Class.

* Age Factor: Children were prioritized for rescue.

* Fare as an Indicator: Higher fares correlated with better survival odds, likely reflecting higher-class
   tickets.

* Family Size: Moderate family size (1–3 members) saw better survival chances than traveling alone or
   with large groups.

* High Casualty Rate: Overall survival rate was low (38%), showing the severity of the Titanic disaster.

Tools Used:

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn
